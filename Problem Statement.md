Problem Statement



* Security and Compliance: With international operations, Ziko must adhere to various data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. The current systems need to be more robust in terms of security measures and compliance mechanisms, posing a risk to data integrity and privacy.



* Real-Time Data Processing: The logistics industry demands real-time data processing for critical operations such as route optimization, inventory management, and delivery scheduling. Ziko’s existing batch-processing framework is inadequate for such needs, affecting the company's responsiveness and agility.





Addressing these challenges is paramount for Ziko Logistics. The data engineering team is tasked with designing and implementing a scalable, secure, and efficient data infrastructure that not only meets current operational demands but also anticipates future business requirements, ensuring Ziko remains at the forefront of the logistics industry.
